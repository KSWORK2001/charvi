          Hey Butterball! Can you believe it? We've surpassed the one-month milestone! It feels like just yesterday when we connected on Tinder. Remember how you raised an eyebrow at my Tinder Gold status, thinking it might be a red flag? And then I dropped the US Citizenship joke, nearly scaring you off? Haha, I'm so glad you stuck around. Right from the get-go, our vibes clicked, though we did freak out a bit over the age gap.

          Throughout this past month, we've exchanged countless romantic messages and calls. But amidst all that, I've come to realize that you're not just a girlfriend; you're my partner. You're romantic enough to make my heart flutter, caring enough to design my diet plans (lmao), funny and smart enough to always bring joy and pride into my life. But above all, you're someone I can share everything with, someone who truly gets me, and also my best friend. You're the most brilliant and talented (and hottest) person I've ever met, yet you've made room for me in your life. You've turned me into a grandpa Gen Z, given me countless headaches, and introduced me to the Skibidi Toilet Lore (still no clue). We've roasted fat people together, said horrendous things that could land us behind bars for 20 years easily, and made questionable jokes (we're both insane), but hey, at least we're making memories!

          And as I sit here writing this, my mind is flooded with so many things I want to say. Every time I think of you, my heart skips a beat, and I'm reminded of just how special you make my life. There's a rush of emotions, a whirlwind of thoughts, all centered around the sheer joy and love you bring into my world. From the smallest gestures to the grandest displays of affection, you have a way of making every moment feel magical. You're the missing piece that completes me, the light that brightens even my darkest days. I could go on for hours, pouring my heart out to you, expressing just how much you mean to me. But even then, words would fail to capture the depth of my feelings. So, for now, I'll simply say thank you for being you, for gracing my life with your presence, and for making every moment with you a cherished memory.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p className="main-paragraph">
          You are perfect in every conceivable way, and I love you more than words can express. You're "quite" literally the epitome of everything I've ever dreamed of, and I am grateful every day for the blessing of having you in my life. So here's to us, to our love, and to the countless adventures that await us in the next 80 years. I love you more than you'll ever know.
